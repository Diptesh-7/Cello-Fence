  India, one of the world's leading food producers, faces significant challenges in food storage, including poor infrastructure, post-harvest losses, and a lack of modern facilities. Fruit preservation is crucial, affecting both farmers and consumers. Despite advances in storage and transportation technology, significant post-harvest losses occur mainly due to ethylene release during storage and transport. These losses cause economic hardship for farmers, contribute to food poverty, and lead to environmental degradation through increased waste. Traditional fruit preservation techniques, such as refrigeration and chemical treatments, have limitations in efficacy, sustainability, and safety. Refrigeration requires significant energy and infrastructure, especially in areas with limited electricity, while chemical treatments pose risks of residues, environmental pollution, and consumer health issues, such as potassium permanganate making food toxic upon contact. The global demand for fresh fruits year-round necessitates novel preservation technologies that extend shelf life while maintaining quality and nutritional content. Sustainable, cost-effective, and scalable alternatives to fruit preservation are critically needed. By integrating renewable and biodegradable sources for nanocellulose production, we can ensure the sustainability of packaging materials and reduce environmental impact. Using nanocellulose for ethylene absorption has the potential to significantly reduce food waste and improve fruit preservation efficiency in the supply chain.​​
